Exploring and analyzing a dataset containing career race results of PCS top 200 female riders

### Dataset Description
This dataset was originally from [Sean Hardison](https://github.com/seanhardison1/pcs) wherein he made a data package containing aggregated rider data from procyclingstats.com (PCS). I specifically used the `rider_records_women.csv` dataset which contains the race results of the top 200 ranked female cyclists by PCS throughout their pro career.

### Exploration through SQL
I wanted to see which cyclist were the best and most consistent by aggregating the UCI points they scored (`ucipoints`). Functions used were simple aggregations and Windows functions. Later on, the `Views` saved can be used for data visualizations.
